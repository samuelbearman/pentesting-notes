# Fuzzing


Fuzzing is similar to brute forcing but with a little more smart


It allows for you to test for specific parameters that you give it in urls.

An Example:

``` bash
wfuzz -c -z file,dates.txt http://10.10.161.24/api/site-log.php?date=FUZZ

# -z specifies payload, which we are using a .txt file filled with dates
# FUZZ will be replaced in each line of the .txt file
# -c is just for colors
# Other Notes:
# -d is used for body of a request like: "username=FUZZ&password=FUZZ"
