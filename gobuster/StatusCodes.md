# Satus Codes

Sometimes gobuster will not work properly based on how a website has return status codes

We can use the -s Flag for Gobuster to specifiy that we want a return on certain http status codes back.

A 200 Status code is one of many that will return back, so we can do out normal gobuster:

``` bash
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.16.189 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -s "204,301,302,307,401,403"
```

We specify to return back a result if any of the pased in status codes
