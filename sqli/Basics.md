# Sql Injection

With Sql injection we are trying to first find an injectable query via a web application.

This might be a login page or a search field for instance.

Once we find something we think is injectable, we test it by sending it 'sql like' data and inspect the reponse.

For a login page, we might send username and password and the resulting sql query to check if this is correct might be:

``` sql
SELECT username,password FROM users WHERE username='@EnteredUsername' and password='@EnteredPassword'
```

The application code, when running this query is looking to see if anything is returned, if there is then it is a valid match, if not its an error.

If we are able to get the query to return something then we can bypass the check.

So our injection might be:


UserName: ``` admin' or 1=1 --' ``` 
Password: test

This will make the query only run the where username part of the selection and drop the password due to being commented out with '--'
