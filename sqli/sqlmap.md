sqlmap is a handy tool for testing sql injections easily and automatically.

Most simple way is to run a command that you think is injectable in BurpSuite and save as a file

Then run something like:

``` bash
sqlmap -r filename --dump-all 

```
 
There are many other useful flags to use as well to get content from the database
